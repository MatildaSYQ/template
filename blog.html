The WRA 110 writing class aims at ensuring the following:
1.	Assist students in learning strategies and practices of research. 
2.	Help students keep tabs on critical life issues, as well as open up their minds to develop informed perspectives.
3.	Comply with the University rules and regulations as a student.
4.	Learn how to write, of course.
I am, therefore, setting the course on determining whether I succeeded in attaining all the goals of the class. I have outlined some relevant course material in my blog. Have I succeeded or failed in my quest? You be the judge.

To better organize the content of my blog, I have divided it in three main areas according to the class assignments, namely,
I.	In class activity 1.
II.	In class activity 2.
III.	In class activity 3.
In addition, I have also incorporated some articles that were related to class topics on various issues. These are:
A.	Economic literature.
B.	Modern culture and literature.
C.	Life and photography.
I communicate my thoughts and ideas by writing. Not only does this offer therapeutic benefits, I also get to speak with the reader. To ensure proper content analysis, I spend a lot of time and effort in research. This guarantees that I provide accurate information to the reader, as well as develop material that is well informed, keeping in mind current trends. This allows me to come up with timely content that resonates well with the changing or emerging tendencies in the issue at hand. This is well exhibited in my essays. I have also provided materials used in the research process that offers the foundation for the essay. In addition, each topic has the lessons I learnt from the writing and research processes.

In-class Assignment 1
The main objective of this class assignment was to analyze a video and present the following:
Purpose of the video

The video itself focused on the gay sex marriages. Born in a Christian background, Randy Robert Potts had a difficult time growing up. This was because of his sexual preferences, as he was gay. His grandfather, Oral Roberts, was a renowned televangelist, who was a great crusader of anti-gay relationships. According to him, gay people were an abomination.
This video attempts to present the difficult situations gays have to contend with and, at the same time, offers hope and consolation to those involved.
How the video attempts to achieve its purpose

The video uses a unique communication media through writing. Robert Potts is an acknowledged writer. He applies his skill to communicate his message of hope. The video itself is filled with written texts that employ a unique font to add a soft touch to the message. The record has acknowledged both sound and text to convey the message. This enables the point to be communicated to all types of people who can either hear, read, or both, hence, reaching its target audience.
Structure of the message

The message takes into consideration the owner’s background, explaining the context of religious beliefs, and how they affected the situation of the writer. He indicates that the Christianity background, a vital pillar in his upbringing, would disdain of it. His son, the writer’s uncle, Robert, ironically was gay. He faced rejection from his own family, leading Robert to commit suicide. The writer suffered the same fate, refusal from his family on account he was gay. Despite the denial from family and society, he presents a message of hope, indicating that it indeed gets better with time.
Connection between the video structure and the real life experiences

The video takes into consideration the past of the writer, as well as the action he undertook to achieve his goal of promoting gay rights. In relation to this, the structure of the video helped a great deal to relate to the real life experiences project.

According to my project, my encounter with photography started back in my childhood, when I was spending time with my father. He used a camera to capture the special moments we had together, and this was one of the main reasons I decided to venture into photography. To achieve my goal of becoming a photographer, I made up my mind to enroll in a professional photography class in college in order to get equipped with the expert skills necessary for a photographer.
My passion in photography was the main driving force in the course and, therefore, did what it took to become a professional at it.

In-Class Activity 2
This assignment took into consideration The Social Media film and its relation to the class topics as discussed below.
The role of women in Tech industry
The industry was a male dominated area with very low women penetration levels. This was due to the popular belief that men were smarter than women. Unexpectedly, the film goes further to accentuate this fact despite being produced in the 21st century. This is because the movie portrays women in a negative light. For instance, Aaron Sorkin indicates that females in the picture are prizes. The film depicts that women have no role in the industry. This is in accordance with its theme which was: ‘defining a decade’. In the movie, females are portrayed as loose and their lack of contribution to the tech industry is also represented.
Effect of technology upon writing and communication

The Social Network film is based on real life experience on the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. The presence of Facebook brings a dramatic change to communication trends. In this case, different people from various parts of the world can keep in touch, at the same time share their experiences on the online platform. With Facebook, individuals can share their photos, as well as provide contact information to their friends. In this way, people are able to communicate in an affordable manner. 
Correlation between formal education and Economic and personal success

It is a popular belief that education leads to success. However, according to the film, this is not so. The lead actor, who represents the Facebook founder, unfortunately, does not complete his degree at the prestigious Harvard University. Instead, he chooses to pave his own path without an educational background by inventing a social network program. He quits school and decides to venture the technology industry on his own.

As a result of his shrewdness, he recognizes an opportunity and steals an idea from the Winklevoss brothers by shortchanging it. He goes on to become a game changer in the tech industry. Zuckerberg’s invention, Facebook, goes on to turn into a phenomenal success and, as a result, becoming a billionaire at the young age of early twenties. The film proves that education in itself does not necessarily lead to success. What it does is improving the chances of success but with ambition, hard work, and passion, one can achieve what he/she wants in life.

In-Class Activity 3
This activity aimed at presenting advertisements and their impact on portraying the aspects indicated. This is discussed below:
Imagery of Detroit

The Chrysler 200 advert was staged in Detroit, Eminem’s hometown. The advert has been criticized as many viewers did not grasp the concept of the ad. The advertisement focuses more on the comeback of Detroit rather than the Chrysler 200.  As a student in the WRA 101 writing class, the concept of the ad has been lost entirely. The incorporation of Detroit does little to help with the comprehension part. Despite this lack of comprehension, the ad has gone on to become a success. The advert takes into consideration the rundowns the city has been through but billows with hope as a result of its ambitious people.
Inclusion of Eminem ‘Lose yourself’

Eminem plays the central figure in the advert. Being from Detroit, where the ad is staged, he becomes a fit in the advertisement that seeks to reinvent the city. However, this does not come out clearly. The inclusion of Eminem in the advert has no impact on the advert.
 
In addition, the audience does not understand Eminem’s role and indicates that the ad is a waste of money. 
Tagline ‘Imported from Detroit’

Chrysler as a company has been trying to rebuild itself after its bankruptcy and the consequent bailout in 2009. Having been taken over by Fiat, another car manufacturer, the company has been trying to rise from the ashes. This can be indicated in its Super Bowl commercial in Detroit and the tagline, which main intention was to communicate a sense of patriotism for the residents since it has its roots in the city. Despite the lack of comprehension among the 2000 car-buyers in the survey, the advert has gone on to become popular. This is evidenced by the half a million new views in Chrysler’s YouTube channel.
The voiceover

The grisly-voiced narrator on the background presents a forceful impact on the commercial. The combination of the narration plus the picture content indeed plays a big part in influencing the message of the advert. His words are carefully aligned to match the intended impact that of hope. This is well achieved in the advert and its effect is one that touches a nerve in a hopeful way

ECONOMIC LITERATURE 
One might wonder whether Economics, a subject involving a lot of charts and graphs, really applies writing styles. Before I undertook this assignment, I was in the same boat, and the answer is yes.

This task enabled me to know the difference between creative writing and academic writing styles. The dissimilarity lies in the rules, styles, and analyses of each approach. However, for the purposes of relevance to this class assignment, I have focused on the academic writing style in the field of Economics.

Before exploring these styles, I discovered that I cannot really write anything without involving research. Research is essential in writing of any economic article.  This shapes the backbone of this aspect as explained further below:
Research and Economics

Mathematical modeling, fieldwork, econometrics, and literature review are the main facets involved in economic research. Each of these will be further explored in due course of this blog, highlighting what are involved, academic styles present in each, as well as relevant examples to enhance your understanding.
•	Fieldwork

Fieldwork involves the going out to the site and using relevant data collection methods, mostly primary sources to gather information. In this case, the researcher collects first hand data and, therefore, relates well with the topic at hand, providing accurate and timely information. To this effect, the researcher can apply different techniques such as observation, use of questionnaires and undertake surveys depending on the demands of the data on the topic at hand.

Unfortunately, most economists do not carry out any fieldwork. In the end, their work has gaps as a result of applying inconclusive data. To this effect, their labor does not communicate in an accurate and timely manner. Therefore, what is the impact of fieldwork on research?
</P>
<P><H2>BLOG6</H2>
Firstly, economists are able to collect clear information from the economic factors. This is because they gather first-hand data from the respondents themselves. As opposed to secondary sources, the economists are able to instigate the respondent for more information or even clarify on an issue that is incomprehensible.

Secondly, fieldwork allows researchers to explore areas that few have ventured into. As a result, their work authenticity and credibility increases.  

Data collection instruments used in the fieldwork must be carefully thought out while ensuring a high degree of concentration when constructing them. This guarantees that the questions are understood by the respondents. It, therefore, plays a huge role in the supply of accurate information.

While collecting facts, it is impossible to do so in a large population due to financial constraints. To avoid complex data analysis, sample determination plays a big role in the research process. The researcher must ensure that the sample is representative of the entire target population.

A hypothesis assists the examiner to provide the focus of the research. In the end, the researcher can determine whether the theory is approving or disapproving. 
•	Literature Review
This is a form of research that involves the use of secondary sources of information such as scholarly articles, peer-reviewed journals, textbooks, and documented research on the topic.
The main aim of the literature review is that it provides a theoretical framework that is related to the research topic. However, economists should be careful not to compromise the authenticity of their work owing to the use of other researchers’ ideas.

After research is carried out, the facts and information are then documented in the articles. Irrespective of the nature of the articles, formal and objective language should be used. The writer should also employ appropriate citation and referencing styles while using another person’s work. This avoids academic theft, plagiarism.
Materials used
</P>
<P><H2>BLOG7</H2>
To apply the above concepts, I have used various examples to portray the different writing styles that writers have applied in their work as discussed below: 
Joseph Farrell and Carl Shapiro.  “Antitrust Evaluation of Horizontal Mergers: An Economic Alternative to Market Definition.” The B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics Policies and Perspectives, 10.1(2010). 1-34.

The guiding theme of the above article is to describe an approach useful in analyzing concerns regarding the effect of unilateral price in differentiated products markets (Farrell & Shapiro, 2010). This indicates in-text citation popular in the APA writing style. This shows the writer has taken note of other writer’s work (Farrell and Shapiro). The theme provides guidance to the writer, hence, assisting to provide organized work. 

The article also takes footnotes into consideration. Their main purpose is to give explanations that are not outlined clearly in the body of the article. The writer has as well used various theories relevant to the topic at hand. The result is an academic outlook of the paper.
As indicated above, the writer employs formal language in the paper. This is depicted by his lack of references to the first person. The article also presents its facts in a clear and concise manner, hence, stays focused on the topic that provides the guidance. This indicates a formal academic paper.

From the example of the above item, it is imperative to incorporate conclusions of the articles which mark the end point of the study after the consideration of research, theoretical materials, and other resources responsible for the arrival of the conclusion.
</P>
<P><H2>BLOG8</H2>
This report also took the importance of interviews in writing into consideration. To this effect, I incorporated a number of examples to illustrate this point. For instance, in an interview with the author of “How Economics Shapes Science” Paula Stephan, the guiding factors in the book are the fields of Economics and Science. She conclusively indicates that the only way scientists can remain relevant is by providing information on studies that have never been conducted.

Throughout the interview, Stephan outlines her thoughts methodically providing exhaustive information before moving on to the next point. This gives an orderly flow of ideas, an aspect that is considered in research writing. The interview also offers evidence on the importance of providing examples relevant to the topic, as Paula does in the interview to strengthen the discussion of the subject. In addition, she uses quotes and references of past materials; an aspect also considered by other writers indicated throughout the discussion.
Data presentation in Economics

After the collection of information through research, economists need to present the data in a manner that is comprehensible to the reader who is not conversant with economic principles. In effect, to achieve this aim, economists sort out their data in graphs and table. This is because this presentation summarizes important facts and relays it in an understandable manner as they are easy to read. Most graphs that are used in Economics include Demand and Supply curve, as well as the Phillips curve.
Importance of economic literature

Economics is a very important field as it has a direct influence on the quality of life. Therefore, literature of the same assists in understanding market models that have the influence on almost all aspects of life. For instance, Economics helps in the comprehension of macroeconomic aspects, as well as their influence on economic models.
<P><H2>BLOG9</H2>
The importance of research, as part and parcel of the study of Economics, plays a pivotal role in the relay of accurate information. In the interview with Stephan, for instance, research is perceived as extremely essential.
Lessons learnt
The following are important points I derived from the articles and interviews discussed above:
a.	Research forms the foundation for most academic articles as it involves collection of data related to the topic at hand.
b.	Citation and referencing are important in the outline of other writer’s work to avoid committing plagiarism.
c.	Points should be outlined methodically, as well as expounded by the use of either statistics or examples to support them and strengthen the content of the discussion.
d.	Formal language should be used in academic articles. This means that references of the first person should be avoided at all costs.
e.	It is important to understand different academic writing styles. This is achieved by reading widely.
f.	It is crucial to perceive the central aspects in writing, researching, and reading of scholarly materials.
General attitude about Economic literature
My utilization of relevant articles and interviews revealed information that I did not know prior to undertaking this assignment. For instance, I did not know the importance of economic literature let alone the literature involved in the field of economics.

However, I discovered that just like any other academic article, research plays an important role in the collection of data used in the piece of writing. Economic literature is not an exception. I also come to realize more about the impact the field of Economics has on the quality of life. To this effect, I came to appreciate this kind of literature, as well as understood basic principles behind it.

All in all, I found this type of literature insightful and relevant to almost every aspect of the quality of my life.

MODERN CULTURE AND LITERATURE: Blog 5
Culture defines a society. This is because it studies the ways of life of civilization, their beliefs, and practices. The world has evolved a great deal. This is well indicated by technological advances the human race has managed. The fact can be better explained by the numerous discoveries made in almost all aspects of life, such as medical innovations, transport, and communication infrastructure, innovations in the education sector among others. Despite the advancements that have been mentioned, culture has also developed.

This is indicated by the changes in belief systems of most people. For instance, decades ago, people believed that the Earth rotated around the sun. Thanks to science, this has been proved wrong. With reference to the changes in the way of life, emerging trends have contributed to that effect. The current issue of climate transformation has altered the way most people discard their waste by opting for recycling; investments have been made in green technology in an effort to decelerate the effects of climate change. 

Another current trend that has been discussed widely invoking differences in opinion, is that regarding gay rights. In the past, it was even unthinkable of having marriages of the same sex as it was considered ‘immoral’. Debates have surged on with proponents arguing for the legal recognition of same sex marriages, while opponents argue that it goes against the Constitution. 

The theme forms a perfect topic for a literature class. This is because it presents differences in opinions forcing the writer to present his or her views based as per the relevant material in order to come up with an objective conclusion. 
</P>
<P><H2>BLOG11</H2>
For this class, I focused on the TV series, Will and Grace, to indicate the progress that has been made with regard to this issue. The show premiered in the year 1997. Back then, acceptability of lesbians and gays was very low compared to the present days. The show proved successful to have aired for almost 9 years. Other performances that focused on the similar issue, which were started the same year that Will and Grace aired, proved unsuccessful, an example is Ellen. The show went on the set the record despite the negative attitude on the gays and lesbians issue.

The performance involves Will Trumman as the lead actor, who is also gay. Will meets Grace, an interior designer and they go on a few dates. During one of these dates, Will reveals to Grace that he is gay. However, Grace is receptive on the issue, and they decide to be friends. The story is based on a true life experience of the creator of the show, Mutchnick, and Janet, his friend.

The show was contesting with a heterosexual performance, Dharma and Greg for advertisement revenue. Will and Grace proved to be popular. The success of the show by both the gay community, as well as those opposed to it is attributed to the positive light which the performance portrayed of the gay community.

Acceptance of the gay community remains a controversial issue in many homes to date.  Despite the increase in approval ratings of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender community, almost half of American population still rejects such groups of people. As a result, they experienced prejudice in most areas of their lives. The root of the disapproval of the community stemmed from religious, as well as cultural beliefs. To this fact, they consider it a disobedience to God’s instructions which disapproves of same sex relationships.
</P>
<P><H2>BLOG12</H2>
However, despite the disapproving numbers, the perception of such relationships has evidently improved. This has been evidenced by the tolerance of same sex relationships, as well as political support. For instance, the Democrats supported such marriages while Republicans disputed them.  The backing has indeed contributed to the acceptability of these relationships. Another important contributor is the Will and Grace Show. The show brought to focus the aspects of the same sex relationship, hence, led to the enhancement and general improvement of the public perception on the issue.

The acceptability of the concern has indeed improved the lives of those involved in such relationships. This is because they can publicly declare their sexual preferences without being judged. Even though a considerable number still opposes such relationships, there is hope of change in their perception. This can be proved by the Democratic wing acceptance of gay marriages, as well as improvement in approval ratings from the public.

Intergroup connections have proved to be beneficial in the reduction of prejudice against same sex relationships. This has been established by various empirical studies focusing on the same. 

Therefore, in the literary work involving this topic, writers must be careful to portray such relationships in a positive light to encourage acceptability of this sensitive issue.
Lessons learnt
a.	Mainstream media plays a pivotal role in human interaction and perception. This is proven by the Will and Grace Show that changed public view on the issue of same-sex relationships.
b.	Relaying accurate and correct information is important. The show portrayed gay relationships in a positive light, hence, aided in the improvement of public perception. This is because it provided correct facts about the gay community. As a writer, it is, therefore, imperative to present accurate details and data.
c.	Intergroup connections can improve interpersonal relationships, hence; reduce prejudice faced by the minority who are discriminated against by the majority.

LIFE AND PHOTOGRAPHY: Blog 6
It is a common belief that a picture can communicate a thousand words. This idea is further cemented if the context of the photo is relevant to the situation. To this effect, a photo can indeed communicate more than written text.

A camera can capture what an article cannot using words. Therefore, photography is very important field. This is also the reason why media applies photography to relay information to their audience. 

My experience with a camera was unforgettable as it was a major factor I considered while applying for my university major. My first encounter with photography was with my father. He would take pictures that seemed to capture the real emotion of the situation I was in. I instantly fell in love with photography.

The other reason why the field appealed to me was because it provided quality time to spend with my father. Presented with other options, such as drawing and painting, photography would trump the rest. My fascination with shooting was propelled by the fact that, in addition to the visual effect that photos have; the written description accentuates the situation. This is because the combination creates a clear understanding, as well as the reality of the information that the photo tries to relay.

I am usually mesmerized by photos that are shared on Instagram and in photography enthusiasts’ websites. This is because the photos plus their descriptions create the kind of art that speaks to an individual.
</P>
<P><H2>BLOG14</H2>
As for the other forms of art, such as writing and drawing, the impact they have on me is unique but not as deep as photography invokes. I can justify my preference that everybody has different perspectives and, in the same way, is attracted to different interests. To illustrate this, some individuals prefer drawing to writing or vice versa. Owing to their focus on either interest, they have impressive results. However, there are those with an interest in all three fields namely, drawing, writing, and photography. Their incorporation of all of them in their work leads to a genius piece of art.

However, love for photography is not enough. Expert skill is vital for the generation of impactful pictures. For this reason, it is important to seek professional assistance with regards to perfecting your knowledge. This can be obtained from undertaking photography courses in the university.

Professional skills entail art appreciation, lighting technology, photography, photography composition, special photography, non-linear editing, photography, and advertising photography among others.

The discovery of the ‘magic’ the camera possesses has increased the interest in the field of shooting. This is evidenced by the profiles of almost everybody on social media sites, such as Facebook. The consideration of photography as a career has improved such that the studio, newspaper agencies, television, film industry, as well as advertisement and magazine companies demand services in this field.

However, I am interested in working with a magazine company. My desire stems from the fact that I find magazine pictures interesting and thought provoking. Magazines mainly focus on travel, diet, fashion, and science. As a result, travelling comes along with the package. I have a passion for travelling as I get to explore different cultures, as well as worldwide knowledge and experience. This would indeed make me a well-rounded individual.
My favorite periodical is the Chinese Cooking magazine. It focuses on different Chinese culinary delights that are easy to prepare. Working with the magazine would enable me travel to China to collect information about different diets. The photos would indeed capture the Chinese culture and diet preferences. Using my unique point of view and an aesthetic angle, I would communicate through my pictures.

</P>
<P><H2>BLOG15</H2>
Different reasons have their cause for pursuing photography. However, a common motive is interest. Those with an interest in the field are often ready to learn all there is to the profession. Sacrifice is also inevitable. One is, therefore, able and willing to come out of their comfort zones for the sake of what they love and believe in.
Lessons learnt
a.	Picture making cultivates and nurtures personal relationships. Individuals are able to capture life experiences using their cameras and share them with their friends and family. Social sites, such as Wechat and blog websites, have photo provisions where individuals can upload their photos in order to share them with friends.
b.	Photography involves a lot of travelling. This is an effort to capture various experiences of different people and their respective cultures.
c.	Taking pictures exercises the mind, body and spirit. It provides a fulfilling effect on individuals as they are able to express themselves through their photos.
My attitude towards photography
As presented in my essay, I love photography and everything that is involved in the field. The benefits of the field are immense. I am, therefore, keen on developing my skill and willing to work hard in pursuing a career as a professional photographer.
CONCLUSION
My WRA 110 class has indeed equipped me with literary skills that are essential in writing. The different academic styles, research involved, and objectivity that academic writing demands are certainly worth to produce an artistic piece of work. So, have I learnt anything from the course?
