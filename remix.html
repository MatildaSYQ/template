			<h1>Memo</h1>
			<p>The topic I chose for my project that revolves around how technology has improved the attitudes towards homosexuality is a sensitive one. Research to be done was to be objective to avoid upsetting any party to the research. Objectivity on the issue enabled me to alienate personal conviction from the findings that emerge. Having objective views on a research subject helps provide in-depth understanding from a neutral standpoint. This is as opposed to filtering data and information to suite personal inclinations.

Challenges include the use of information to compile the documentary. It is evident that there are those who support homosexuality while some do not. Sources may therefore be inclined to either school of thought. Finding neutral information is thus a serious challenge. The audience that would receive this information would belong to supporters of homosexuality or non-supporters. In that case, the presentation of the information should not incline to any side but give in-depth information on the research topic.

Selection of the topic was based on a consideration of the viewer ratings of the “Modern family” show. The current views towards the program created interest on the situation that has been in the industry. As part of the technology, its role in the acceptability of homosexuality emerged. Objectivity for the project was the most challenging aspect of preparation. It was very tempting to come up with information that reflected on personal conviction on the matter. Nonetheless the need to get both sides as well as the interest gave room for objectivity that enriched the research. A systematic approach was used that included the selection of reputable and reliable sources for the compile the research. This entailed finding peer reviewed empirical evidence and statistics.

The most reliable research sources were empirical articles that gave directing and an overview of the current state and development as concerned the interests of this research. In reading the research, the methodology of the research as well as peer reviews gave confidence in the validity and reliability of the information therein. Non-reliable sources in this case were some internet sources which proved hard to distinguish between the neutral ones from the rest. It required time to read and get the authors point of view.

Group interaction during the project was good. The research to be used in the compilation was vetted by all the members to eliminate bias and to ensure that only neutral sources were used. All in all, the participation of the group in the activity was fruitful. Diverse opinions on the issue under discussion made sure that any sort of bias was avoided. Given that there was a lot of articles to be looked at and vetted, the process would have been more difficult. If there was more time, I would have searched for data that would give a comparison to show the changes in technology and acceptability of homosexuality.

The most effective aspect of the documentary created is the use of common and well known programs to demonstrate a pressing issue or topic. The use of “Modern family” and other examples to illustrate how the media has managed to drive out stereotyping and promoting the acceptability of homosexuality is relevant and a platform that the audience can relate to. Design decisions were based on selection of several alternatives and narrowing to the best option based on the advantages of each and the audience that was to receive the documentary.
