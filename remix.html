			<h1>Remix Proposal Framework</h1>
			<p>1.	Working Hypothesis And Interpretation
Our documentary is aiming to present the positive sides and importance of taking risk. In Economics, if a person is risk averse, it is highly possible that he or she will be reluctant to face uncertainties. In term of investment, a risk averse person would rather accept a more uncertain plan with less payoff than accept an uncertain plan with very high payoff. A risk taker, on the other hand, is a person who would rather to face relatively huge loss, in order to gain more. The major conflict is ideas between risk take and risk adverse – more risk for more gain or less risk for certain gain? Ultimately, we want the audience to understand that taking risk not only benefit individuals but also develop the society.  We also want the audience to feel that many items in our daily life are invented or developed by people who was willing to take risk and then succeeded. 

</p><p>2.	Topic
Our documentary’s subject are successful people who took risk and achieve his or her goal in the past. In order to make audience able to understand the documentary better, a famous and popular video game – Grand Theft Auto and several famous person in the history of United States would be mentioned. Video game is or at once being very close to most of people’s life. It can also allow audience to be interested in the enclosed world of our documentary. Examples of famous person in American history also make audience catch our idea easier. The video game will be shown in a scene that on plays game. The famous person’s stories part would be presented in narrative form with pictures and graph. 

</p><p>3.	Action Sequences
The documentary starts with a question: “how is risk taking”? The hypothesis is that taking risk is advantageous overall, for either individuals or the society. The documentary will first introduce argument of the opposite side – risk aversion and present the shortcoming of risk taking. In the following part of the documentary, each of our group number will tell a story of a successful risk taker – Martin Luther King, Thomas Alva Edison, Chris Gardner, and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. Those four people came from different period and they were in various fields. By doing this, we hope our audience will understand our argument and be inspired.
</p><p>4. Participants    Task-assigned
 MEMBER A.    Use the achievement of Martin Luther King and the example of Elizabeth Cady Stanton (the representative of National Woman Suffrage Association) to state the point that no equality can be achieved without taking risks. One may encounter a great deal of challenge during his or her pursuit of justice. Throughout this process, a person has to face a challenge by taking risks or otherwise he will eventually fail. “No pains, no gains” is an eternal principle. You will never see the rainbow without the rain and wind.
MEMBER B .    Show the point of view that taking risks develop the society, the inspiration and the technology achieved from the risks bring our life convenience and progress. Examples: Thomas Alva Edison, Wright brothers, Alfred Bernhard Nobel, Christopher Columbus.
MEMBER C.     If a person chooses to take a risk for him dream, he can earn a chance to succeed. Examples: Sir Charles Spencer "Charlie" Chaplin, Michael Jackson. The movie ‘The Pursuit of Happiness’, Helen Keller, Ludwig van Beethoven.
MEMBER D.   Taking risks is vital to keep the society progressing. One step you take might be able to change the world. Examples: Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs broke the monopoly of Microsoft. Galileo Galilei discovered that the objects fell with the same acceleration and proved that Aristotle's theory of gravity (which states that objects fall at speed relative to their mass) false. Nicolaus Copernicus proposed the idea of heliocentric theory which is conflict with the religious. The heliocentric theory started a revolution in astronomy.

</p><p>5.	People today become more and more scholasticism and no one dares to risk in our real-life. The participants in this documentary encourage people to take risk and look at the wonderful thing which have come into our life because of the creations. We have several points of views of the benefits of taking risks.

</p><p>6.	We can put some stories about people who follows all the rules without his or her own thought will become a born loser. For example, Napoléon Bonaparte lost in the Battle of Waterloo because his general of reinforcement forces stick to the original plan and headed to the destination while they were close to the battlefield. If he decided to change the plan as the situation changed, the result might be different. 
In this way, the audience will see the shortages of the regular life with no changes.
</p><p>7. ON CAMERA INTERVIEWS
For each interview, list:
a)	Name, role in life, role in documentary’s structure
Name: The interviewers’ name
Role in life: the students who have been taken risk through their experience.
Role in documentary’s structure: Using their experience to explain the main idea of the whole article to make the first portion of the documentary which makes the structure more clear.
b)	Main elements your interview will seek to establish
By using the face to face shots keep the minutes of everyone’s experience. Then express certain events they have been experienced to show the main gist.

</p><p>8. STRUCTURE
Explain how you hope to structure your documentary. When you are doing this, consider:
a)	How you will handle the progression of time in the documentary
In 7-9 minutes, we will manage the progression of time to different part through different ways. For example, the On-camera interview will be considered to put in first place. And some other montages will appear in the left part. For example, we will arrange some story happened on interviewers and put them into the documentary with the format of video.
b)	How and at what point information important to story development will appear
We will perform an event as the transform to lead to important information of the story. Often appear at the middle of the whole time period.
c)	What you intend as the climactic sequence and where this should go
The emotion throughout the whole documentary will be climactic sequence. At the end of the documentary, the main emotion will be expressed more vivid and complicated.
d)	How this relates to other sequences in terms of the action rising toward the documentary’s projected “crisis” or emotional apex and the falling action after it
We have the emotional apex and falling action during the documentary. There will be a story about taking risk with details of case and will be ups and down.

</p><p>9. RESOLUTION
Write a brief paragraph about how you imagine your documentary will end and what you would like the ending to accomplish for the audience. Comparing any intended ending with the documentary’s beginning also exposes what must accomplish as a story to get there. The ending is your last word to the audience and has a disproportionate influence on what the documentary will mean.
I think the end of the documentary will be specific and impressive since a lot of information is going on through the whole documentary, and we need to put something focusing on the main gist about the result of taking risk. We will use some unique and special techniques which always appear in advertisement and some documentary. For example, we will use color effect and amplify some scene to emphasize the main gist in the end.
