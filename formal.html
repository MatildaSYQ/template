			<h1>Formal Research Report</h1>
			<p>This paper focuses on the different literary styles essential in the academic field. Creative writing styles and academic writing styles vary significantly. It is, therefore, essential for all students pursuing higher education to be familiar with the rules, styles and analyses of different sources of information. The paper also provides the expectations in reading, writing and research in the academic field. This research report explores the academic writing styles in the field of economics. Different sources are present in this paper and they show the formal ways of communicating information in the field of economics. By the end of this paper, the distinctive style in formal writing for academic purposes shall be clear.
Research in the field of economics
 	
</p><p>Conducting research in the field of Economics involves the use of mathematical modeling, fieldwork, econometrics, and literature review. Fieldwork comprises of going out to the site of study and carrying out data collection. One then analyses the data and presents it in a manner that viewers can easily understand and interpret the analyzed data. According to Helper (2000), most economists do not conduct fieldwork. This is a weakness in the research of economic topics because research provides clear information from the economic actors. In addition to this, fieldwork allows researchers to explore areas that few have ventured into, and this increases authenticity of research work. When planning to carry out a field research, caution and concentration is necessary in the design of research tools such as questionnaires and interviews (Helper, 2000). Sample selection is also a priority because, to get a true representation of the views of a population; the sample size and selection need to represent the whole community. When one goes to the field for research, they have a hypothesis they are to prove or disprove. The general expectation in the field of economics is that, in addition to proving a hypothesis, one should be able to acquire ideas from the field, and discuss the fieldwork in the published articles to maintain the vividness of the research outcomes. In this way, results from the fieldwork become applicable to economic theory and econometrics.
 	
</p><p>Skepticism among economists is high when it comes to qualitative research techniques (Helper, 2000). Researchers prefer the quantitative techniques such as simulation and econometrics because of their wide scope. It is easier to make projections with a very minimal standard of error when using the quantitative techniques. Another mode of research is the literature review. This entails the use of secondary sources of information such as scholarly articles, peer-reviewed journals, textbooks and documented research on the topic. The information then applies to the thesis of the research to make reports. Students in academic programs rely on this research for their term papers. Although this form of research may seem easy, authenticity of one’s work as an academic should not be compromised. In the field of economics, unique references to the various economic models and theories are necessary. For example, a hypothesis for research can read like “The neoclassical concept of ‘decision’ utility results from the rise of behaviorism and positivism in the early 21st century.” Above all, economists need to maintain their objectivity when carrying out both quantitative and qualitative research.

</p><p>After one carries out the research, writing is the next step. Whether one chooses to write a scholarly article or an article for a journal, the primary requirements are formal and objective language. Just like in any other field, one should only state facts and make objective observations on the topic of research. In addition, the researcher needs to give credit to the source of information in the reports via in text citations and correct listing of references. The art of paraphrasing, summarizing and quoting is also essential when writing a research paper. This reduces the occurrence of plagiarism in one’s work and thus raises the quality of the paper. When summarizing findings from research, one should also provide a list of figures and tables to corroborate the information in the article. In the course of learning, an analysis of an article or journal to portray their understanding of the issues under discussion is a necessity. An example of such a task is available below.

</p><p>Antitrust Evaluation of Horizontal Mergers: An Economic Alternative to Market Definition. The B.E. Journal of Theoretical Economics Policies and Perspectives

</p><p>The aim of this article is to describe an approach useful in analyzing concerns regarding the effect of unilateral price in differentiated products markets (Farrell & Shapiro, 2010). This is the thesis of the article. The article proposes an analysis of two opposing forces that generate upwards pricing pressures. These forces are the loss of direct competition between merging parties and marginal-cost savings (Farrell & Shapiro, 2010). The above thesis provides an insight into the contents of the article. Conventionally, one can locate the thesis of the paper in the introduction paragraph. 
 
</p><p>According to Farrell & Shapiro, there are two competitive effects in mergers, the competitive effect and the unilateral effect (2010). From the article above, the authors state the thesis and provide an analysis of the different theories relating to the topic. A systematic presentation of facts is evident in the paper, and one fact leads to another that explains the previous fact. This orderliness is present in all academic articles. 
 	
</p><p>In addition to this, article provides numerous in text citations and footnotes. The citations show the source of any material from another source. The footnotes, on the other hand, provide explanations on statements that may not be clear in the body of the report. The footnotes sometimes act as citations. In the article, the use of macroeconomic terms such as monopolistic markets, oligopolistic markets, and marginal costs is evident (Farrell & Shapiro, 2010). In addition to this, different economic theories are present throughout the body of the article. For example: the implicit function theorem quantifies profit maximization as π B '(z) / [−π A ''(z)] (Farrell & Shapiro, 2010). It is obvious that when writing a paper or article on economics, including the different theories, economic terms and equations in the paper gives the paper a more academic look. In addition to this, the equations help in explaining significant points within the paper.

</p><p>The writing style in the paper is formal, and there is no reference to the first person in the authors writing. This is because all formal writing should be objective. Farrel and Shapiro do not use the passive tense in writing the report since it is not suitable in formal writing. The presentation of facts and data in the paper is clear and concise without veering off topic. This is another quality of formal writing. Justification for using the upward pricing pressures in mergers is available in the discussion followed by proof (Farrell & Shapiro, 2000). This is an important aspect in report writing and every time one makes a premise, evidence should follow to support the premise.
Economics of Happiness: A Review of Literature and Applications by Nattavudh Powdthavee
 	
</p><p>The above scholarly article is by a student in the Institute of Education, at the University of London. Many times, it is a requirement for a student to review different literature pertaining to an economic topic. This article provides a clear example of how to evaluate papers by different authors and make a clear conclusion. In this paper, the author studies utility functions as a way of determining individual preferences. Powdthavee further compares the different hypotheses about utility and rejects some of the facts as false (2007). For example, the utilitarian view of measurable cardinal utility, which furthers the idea of measuring the scales of utility and that the utility scales of different individuals are comparable, as unscientific. He then states that people may have the same income, buy an item at the same price and yet experience difference levels of satisfaction.
 
</p><p>Figure 1: The curve of marginal utility 
 
</p><p>The writer goes further to describe the different theories such as the Neo-classical theory and the modern economic theory. This shows that he is conversant with his topic of study to the point that he can make comparisons of the different complex economic theories. The researcher explores the application of economic qualitative research techniques such as surveys to measure happiness (Powdthavee, 2007). In addition to this, econometric models evaluating happiness against income levels may also prove useful. He states that in order to make a substantive measurement, economists need to incorporate subjective and objective views. Correlation and causation do not mean the same thing (Epstein, 2011). He states that a high income is not a guarantee for happiness. This is the conclusion that the writer comes to after analyzing the theoretic and econometric data. From this discussion, it is obvious that one needs to incorporate his views into the paper he is analyzing instead of only stating the facts. Conclusions are necessary in all formal papers because they form a summary of the whole discussion and provide the viewpoint of the writer. In addition to this, the conclusion should also contain the thesis of the paper for further emphasis. 

</p><p>Paula Stephan is an economist teaching at the Georgia State University and works with the National Bureau of Economic Research. This interview focuses on the book “How Economics Shapes Science”. In this book, Stephan pursues various themes that are cross cutting in the field of economics and science. In addition to this, she focuses on the special economics of scholarly information and makes an analogy of knowledge being public good (Stephan, 2012). She also observes that though the information is non-rivalrous and non-excludable, scientist use this information to make reports which they turn into goods that give them priority and prestige, which are excludable and rivalrous (Stephan, 2012). She further states that the only way scientists can make themselves a priority is by providing findings on studies no one has conducted. Stephan further comments on authors, cash bonuses, government funding of research, and economic incentives to research in her interview.
 	
</p><p>Throughout the interview, it is evident that Stephan lists her ideas in a methodical manner often providing examples in her discussion. It is also evident that she discusses one question exhaustively before moving on to the net. This method of discussion is applicable to writing research papers. One always needs to provide examples to the topic of discussion and ensure that all aspects of the topic are in the paper. In addition to this, Stephan makes quotes and references to past activities that further the research topic. This technique is essential because this evidence supports the discussion and gives strength to the discussion. Clearly, techniques in both oral and written discussions are similar.
Interview of economist Gerald Epstein
 	
</p><p>He is an employee at the Centre for Popular Economics and a co-founder of University of Massachusetts Political Economy Research Institute. The interview focuses on the journey of progressive economists from Epstein’s view. Epstein (2011) is an advocate for financial reform and started a group SAFER (A committee of Economists and other Experts for Stable, Accountable, Fair and Efficient Financial Reform) that comprises of all economists interested in financial reforms. He has a number of articles to his name such as Globalization and Progressive Economics Policy. The interview revolves around his achievements and contributions towards economic policies in the country. Epstein speaks of the power of the banking industry and the structural blackmail in which, they embroil themselves. In addition to the theoretical explanations, he also provides statistics to support his views. He advocates for the transformation of the financial sector and the creation of public financial services institutions. Epstein further states that the green economy is the way forward in the 21st century. This is because the focus is shifting from the industrialized economies because there is little job creation. 
 	
</p><p>From the above summary, Epstein states his views and elaborates clearly the significant points in the discussion (2011). Just like in the previous interview, it is clear that the tone of the interview is formal, and Epstein provides verifiable facts to support his arguments. For example, he states that, before the year 2008, the financial sector accounted for 60% of the profits in the economy of the United States. It is vital to give facts in discussions because verifiable facts give a report its credibility. In addition to this, Epstein states the way forward in the global economy and endorses a green economy. Moreover, his criticism of the industrialized economies reinforces his stand on the green economy.
Data presentation in the field of economics
 	
</p><p>After carrying out research and compiling the data from the different paper, economists need to present the data in an understandable manner. The presentation of data should be in such a way that even one that is not an economist can study and understand the data. It is necessary to comprehend what the economist is trying to communicate. In the field of economics, the primary data presentation methods are graphs and tables. This mode of presentation is very efficient because one can easily understand data in a diagrammatical representation. Some of the most general graphs in the economic field are supply and demand curve, and the Phillips curve as seen below.

Contributions of the field to the quality of life and economics 
 	
</p><p>Economics is an important field that is applicable in all aspects of life. For some people, it is the study of supply and demand while others prefer to approach it from the macro and microeconomic point of view. Whichever the approach, the importance of economic literature in the economy and the quality of life cannot be ignored. Economic literature helps in understanding the national and global economies. Since everyone in the world has at one point or another participated in the buying and selling of goods or services, economics is applicable to everyone. Economics control economic factors such as interest rates, pricing of goods and services and inflation. Studying economics, therefore, facilitates the understanding of these macroeconomic factors and helps in finding ways to regulate these factors in order to stabilize the economy. Economics is applicable to the banking industry, service industry, manufacturing industries and aviation industries. It is obvious that economics is a pervasive field that is interdisciplinary in its applications. 
 	
</p><p>The contribution of economics to the quality of life is mainly through the formulation of policies that improve living standards in different countries (Epstein, 2011). According to Paula Stephan (2012) in her interview concerning her book, she states that knowledge is a public good. This means that knowledge is easily available and shared. In addition to this, she speaks of funding from the federal government and how this impacts on research. Stephan further states that legislation such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) that provides funding for research is essential to education. Paula tackles issues concerning science, research and development from an economic perspective. The use of economics to improve the field of education, research and science, is an important contribution. Economics contributes to the daily decisions individuals make. Where they eat, where they live, whom they support, politically and how they interact. It is, therefore, evident that economics not only contributes to the financial economy, but to the quality of life as well.
 	
</p><p>According to Powdthavee (2007), economics can be used to measure happiness or subjective well-being. He states that by using single-item or multiple-item questionnaires on how satisfied people think they are, one can get a measure of happiness. Examples of such surveys include the World Values Survey, the Eurobarometer Survey, and the General Social Surveys of the United States. It is obvious that the applications of economics to the quality of life are limitless (Powdthavee, 2007). Economic equations are applicable to all types of real life situations to make future projections.
 	
</p><p>It is clear from the analysis of the articles and interviews above that, economics is an interdisciplinary field. It is also evident that the issues surrounding the presentation of data are similar in both oral and written presentations. Presentation of premises and theses followed by facts and evidence are fundamental to reporting in the academic circles. The most common writing style for formal purposes avoids the passive tense and entails presentation of facts as they appear. In the oral interviews, the interviewees maintain a formal but entertaining tone which captures the audience. Objectivity of a researcher and writer is also essential to avoid bias. Moreover, it is important to understand the important aspects in writing, researching and reading of scholarly materials. In conclusion, the communication of information in the academic field is almost similar. The formal tone in the oral and written discussions is a reflection of this fact. In order to write acceptable academic literature, one needs to read widely to capture the different writing styles.
