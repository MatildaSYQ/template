			<p>Introduction
As part of Michigan State University education requirements, writing in the first year contributes to the university’s mission. This is done through laying a focus on inquiry based learning, which in the end assists students to develop attitudes, skills and knowledge that augment the value of life for themselves and other people through professional, scholarly and social proficient activities. It also enables them to appreciate themselves as an integral part of the University’s community of scholars and commit themselves to inquiring critical questions in order to get adequate answers for such inquiries.  

The materials and activities involved in coming up with the literary autobiography were very helpful. For instance, the links enables students to learn how to use different referencing styles, such as APA and MLA. The Emig readings empower students with skills on how to do empirical undertakings through availing of practical examples. The activities are hands on experience that in the end develops students’ skills in research.
Cultural Analysis

America is not speaking from one script as a nation when it comes to the issue of same sex marriages and gay rights. While some members of the American public support gay marriages, others are against it. This situation also applies to members of the political class. The year 1998 goes down in the American history as the year in which a majority of Americans prejudiced homosexuals. In spite of this opposition to homosexuals, “Will & Grace,” a program starring gay marriages on NBC succeeded beyond the wild imaginations of its conveners. At first, its directors thought that it would fail but by 2006, the show had already gained popularity owing to its impact on the perceptions American people in accommodating same sex marriages. The situation was not as tense when the show wound up in 2006 as it were in 1998 (Helper Web).

Despite the show’s success, there is still much to do to ensure that prejudice against same sex marriages is completely eradicated from the American communities. The program that premiered on the American media with its main character being gay, ended tragically. “Ellen” which premiered in 1997 on ABC had Ellen Morgan as its main character. Ellen, a Lesbian by choice, faced a lot of prejudice from the American audiences. Initially, the reciprocation was nice to her but eventually, she ended up miserably. The reason for this turn out of events is that the American society had no room for same sex marriages. Paradoxically, “Will & Grace” went on to be aired on the ABC network in spite of the fact that the Television network was well aware of the prejudice the American audiences had against its main character “Ellen” (Helper Web). 

People who are LGBT (Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, and Transgender) have attracted mixed reactions from both the American citizens and Political class. As much as the LGBT cohort are rapidly attracting supporters of their rights, 50% of the American citizens still think they do not belong to their communities. This form of prejudice is particularly high amongst the adult population, college students, and adolescents. The reasons for this prejudice against people who are LGBT range from cultural to religious beliefs. However, it is clear that the American public have started accommodating the LGBT cohort owing to an unrelenting media campaign (Helper Web).

Homosexuality, as a subject, became more dramatic amongst members of the political class than amongst the American citizens in the run up to a number of general elections. While Republicans were vehemently opposed to same sex marriages in 2004, the Democrats supported it but did not publicly endorse it until a year later. Consequently, the republicans in the end banned same sex marriages on the ballot papers of their key swing states (Helper Web). 

Before “Will & Grace” premiered, most same sex marriage had a negative representation. Persons who are LGBT were depicted as deviants in most of these previous programs. Consequently, prejudice against people who are LGBT stemmed from these previous shows. The successes of  “Will & Grace” in warming up to the Americans opposed to gay marriages indicates that if the right platform is properly put into use, then prejudice against people who are LGBT is likely to be completely eradicated. Today, more shows that exhibit gays as good people are aired on Television networks to attract sections of the American public who still have a negative perception of people who are LGBT. Doubling this effort will ensure that the prejudice against the LGBT cohort is likely to be completely eradicated in the near future (Helper Web). 
How to Write Formal Research Reports

In order to conduct a successful research in economics, it is critical to make use of literature reviews, mathematical modeling, fieldwork, and econometrics. The gathering of data in the outdoors is what entails fieldwork. Upon gathering data in the field, a researcher has to evaluate and present it in a manner that the audience can comprehend. However, Helper argues that most researchers avoid conducting fieldwork. This has crippled most research work in economics since this niche completely relies on feedback from people on the ground. Apart from that, the outdoors enables investigators to get firsthand information in areas where few people have attempted. This is what leads to legitimacy of research since it is original in nature. Before any empirical undertaking, it is critical to be cautious about data collection instruments such as questionnaires and surveys (Helper Web).  

How one selects his sample of participants is also very critical since it affects generalizability of the research findings to an entire population in the end. Before any empirical undertaking, a researcher has to come up with a hypothesis, which is to be approved or disapproved by the research findings. However, in economics, apart from approving or disapproving a hypothesis, researchers should not only be in a position to collect data from the outdoors but also to publish their research findings in order to authenticate the originality of their research. Because of this requirement, such findings apply to economic theories and may help to forecast future occurrences of the same phenomena (Helper Web). 	

Economists are very skeptical of qualitative techniques. Therefore, they prefer quantitative methodologies because of the fact that they cover a wide range of issues. Apart from that, economics can make projections with minimal errors through using quantitative methodologies. Literature review also aids economists in conducting their empirical undertakings. This involves employing secondary information sources, for instance, documented research on the topic, scholarly articles, textbooks, and peer-reviewed journals (Helper Web). 

This kind of information is then applied in the formulation of an empirical undertaking’s thesis in order to come up with reports. It is these kinds of reports that are actually used by students in various universities to write their term papers. As much as this kind of research seems easy, the validity of the entire undertaking is very critical. In economics, it is very important to come up with exclusive positions on the various models and theories pertinent to the validation of an empirical undertaking. 

Upon completing an empirical undertaking, the next step is to write down the findings. It is critical to be objective and write in a formal language, regardless of whether it is an academic thesis or an article for a paginated journal. The researcher should be concise through stating clear objective observations and being factual. Apart from that, it is important to avoid plagiarism since this is a punishable offence. Plagiarism can be avoided by citing in the text any material used as well as referencing it after concluding the paper. It is therefore critical for a researcher to up his game when it comes to quoting, paraphrasing and summarizing. This not only minimizes plagiarism but also increases the paper’s quality (Helper Web). 
Lived Experiences

I have vivid memories of my father using an old Kodak camera to take pictures of me. He really enjoyed the process of recording these valuable moments by using his old camera. In addition, it was the happiest moment of my life to spend time with my father since that old camera gave us a lot of fun when we took pictures of each other. My interest in photography came from my father’s old camera. I think it is amazing in retrospect, the entire picture taking with the old camera. It represents my childhood as well as my growing. Every single shot prompts me to recall the beautiful moments of my life. From then on, I was addicted to taking pictures using my father’s camera (Helper Web). 

I got my own camera when I was age 12, which was the best thing that ever happened to me. I still remember that memorable day; how I hysterically started taking photos of everyone and was not able to control my excitement. I used it to record my life and splashed the pictures on the internet through the photography enthusiasts’ websites. I have met many shutterbugs through the internet and I have had really good communication with them about photography. I enjoy this process just like my dad (Helper Web).

The reason I chose to study photography at the University is not only because cameras can help me record the important moments in life, but because it enables me to meet new friends and build a fulfilling network. Someday, a friend of mine came to ask me which subject is most appealing to me amongst photography, drawing, and writing. After thinking for a moment, I responded that I preferred photography. However, writing and drawing cannot be neglected. Everyone has unique personal perspectives about these subjects. However, I think this kind of aesthetic cannot be more described. I have kept a watchful eye on some friends’ posts by tagging them (Helper Web). They often write some suitable and beautiful sentences under the pictures they take which makes them more vivid and accessible. 

Some of the pictures with drawings and writings are so attractive that one cannot stop staring at them for they resonate with people’s inner feelings. This is also the reason why I like photography: it is able to mix different art forms to produce something great. In reality, most people can shoot but cannot write, or are able to write but cannot draw, or can draw but cannot shoot. However, in my perspective, everyone has what it takes to be creative, regardless of the disparity in the artistic forms (Helper Web).
Remix Proposal Framework

This documentary’s objective is to present the importance inherent in taking risks. People who are perceived to be risk averse cannot take any economic risks. When it comes to investment, people who are indisposed to risks would rather accept uncertain plans with fewer payoffs than certain plans with very big pay offs. However, risk takers would rather face enormous losses in order to make exorbitant profits. A critical disparity exists between risk takers and those who are indisposed to risks. The objective of this program is to let the audience comprehend that if they take risks, this would not only benefit them but would also lead to the development of the society (Helper Web).  

The main subjects in the proposed documentary are prominent people in the society who after taking risks not only obtained their goals, but also went on to positively impact the society. To make the documentary be better comprehended by the audiences, Grand Theft Auto, which is a trendy video game, and several outstanding individuals in the history of the Unite States of America will take center stage. Most people in the American society have had an experience with video games. With the help of celebrities, the main idea behind this documentary is likely to be well understood by the audiences (Helper Web). 

The documentary’s hypothesis is that people have a lot to gain and nothing to lose by taking risks. Arguments on both sides of the divide on risk aversion will be introduced by the documentary. Each of the panelists will move to the podium and narrate a historical event concerning any previous successful risk takers. These renowned risk takers include Mark Zuckerberg, Martin Luther King, Chris Gardner and Thomas Alva Edison. The fact that these four iconic figures lived in four different eras and stemmed from different niches is likely to make the program’s audiences comprehend the documentary’s argument and be motivated  (Helper Web).

The documentary is likely to be impressive because most information would be directed through the documentary’s program. Apart from that, the directors will include something on the part of the celebrities on the significance of risk taking. For instance, some scenes would be amplified through color effects to ultimately lay emphasis on the major guests (Helper Web).

The United States has been divided on the issue of gay rights and marriage. There is a section of the society that supports them while the other one does not. The same has been the case among the political leaders. In 1998, the situation was worse, and a majority of American citizens were opposed to gays. Still, NBC premiered a show named “Will & Grace”, which succeeded amidst fears of failure given the record set by the shows before it that focused on the same topic. The show aired until 2006, and by then the acceptability of lesbians and gays was low, but it has improved. In accordance, the show had made a vital contribution on the reduction of prejudice. Despite this, there is the need of having a solution that would provide a sustained improvement in the acceptability of gays in the community. 

The first time a lead character was gay on a primetime show, the end results were devastating. “Ellen” first aired on ABC in 1997 and featured Ellen Morgan. She was a lesbian struggling with her personal life as a gay American. Initially the reception was good, but that drastically reduced and eventually it was a total failure. The reaon of the failure is that American public is lack of tolerance of gay and community. Many critics viewed this outcome to have been attributed to the American public lack of tolerance on gay communities. Interestingly, in 1998 “Will & Grace” premiered on NBC despite the negative reception of Ellen.
The show follows Will Truman, a lawyer based in New York City who is from a relationship with a man. Truman has a friend, Grace Adler, who is an interior designer. She is straight, and at the beginning of the show, she left her fiancé on the wedding day. In college, the two began dating before Will revealed to Grace that he was gay. Given the fact that Grace is straight, they decided to be friends for the rest of their lives. The relationship between the two was based on a relationship between one of the creators, Mutchnick, and Janet his friend. 

Will’s friend, Jack McFarland, also features prominently in the cast. He is also gay and play the role of a comic relief together with Karen Walker who is Grace’s assistant. Critics and gay right institutions hailed the show because it had a positive representation of gays. In some extent, the show was competing for advertisement money with a show based on a heterosexual relationship “Dharma and Greg”, which was not a mean achievement for the creators of the show.

The issue of homosexuality has been of public debate for a long time. In the United States, the issue of homosexuality has been of public debate for a long time. In living rooms and in Congress, it has been an issue attracting arguments from both sides. Despite the fact that approval ratings of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, and Transgender (LGBT) has been increasing, almost half of the American population does not approve of the relation according to the year of 2012 statistics. In 1998 when “Will and Grace” was premiering, the lack of approval for gay marriages was high. At the time, homosexual prejudice was at its peak, and it was manifested in various dimensions within the society. Some of the sections that homosexuality prejudice was highest were among college students, adolescents, and the adult population. While some Americans viewed it as a taboo because of their religious beliefs, some used cultural practices as their argument against the practice. Evidently, the public is changing its perception of LGBT, and the television has been a significant contributor.
	
On the political scene, events surrounding the issue of homosexuality have been more dramatic than in the general public. The Republicans, in the year of 2004, were opposed to the subject of same sex marriage while the Democrats supported it, but could not publicly endorse it until last year. In effect, the Republicans made a move of banning same-sex marriage on ballots in Oregon, Michigan, and Ohio, which were key swing states. 
	
The show made an effort of changing the image of the gay community on popular television. Prior to “Will & Grace” many shows in television on homosexuality were either represented negatively or absent. Mainstream television shows such as “Hawaii Five-O”, “M.D.”, and “Marcus Welby” are examples of media that portrayed homosexuals as deviants. Clearly, the perception was adopted from the view of the audience of these shows.  
	
“Will & Grace” sought to represent the challenges of gays in establishing relationships. Still, it approached the issue of LGBT in a positive manner, which was not the case in many television shows with gay characters. There had been many negative stereotypes concerning gay men in television shows around the country. In many instances, which led the failure of many shows such as “Ellen”, there is a challenge of the heterosexual equilibrium.
	
In many shows, the assumption has been that portraying lesbians positively would be extended to the gays. “Will & Grace” moved from this norm towards the realization of the fact that gays are different, and they require a positive representation. Many of the viewers of the shows, according to studies, stated that they knew at least one gay person. This is an indicator that the show was reaching an audience and affecting their perception of the gay community.  
	
This has been successful given the fact that today, the approval ratings have increased, and the Democratic Party publicly embraces gay marriages. With a large portion of the public, movie creators, and political leaders indicating their unwillingness to support gays, “Will & Grace” embarked on a course to change this perception. The show sought to eradicate the stereotyping of the gay community through representing them positively in the mainstream media. This has been successful given the fact that today, the approval ratings have increased, and the Democratic Party publicly embraces gay marriages. In addition, the President of the United States of America supports same-sex marriage. The last episode of “Will and Grace” aired in 2006, and because of its success another show, “Modern Family” is now airing. The latter portrays gays positively.   

Empirical studies into the issue of ethnic and minority groups segregation indicates that promotion of intergroup contact can have a positive effective in the reduction of prejudice of these groups by the majority. Essentially, there is the need for the minority groups to feel a sense of belonging, shared goals, non-superficial contact, and an equal status. In accordance, the eradication of stereotyping gays can only be possible through improved intergroup contact.  
	
Given the fact that the challenge involved in the issue of gay rights is lack of the right information, it is vital to provide adequate positive information about LGBT. When members of a society have sufficient information concerning a certain issue, they may change the perception that they have concerning such topics. 
	
We can improve the relationship between the general public and minorities in a society by strengthen social interaction like mediated interaction. Studies indicate that the use of a para-social interaction model may have positive results in the reduction of prejudice among a minority group. Scholars in the communication sector indicate that para social is a mediated interaction, which is similar to interpersonal interactions. This is because the human brain will perceives media experiences in a similar manner that it does with direct experiences. This means that the effect experienced by individuals through direct contact is possible through para social interaction. This interaction is in most cases referred to as a standard consequence of TV watching. This is an indicator of the fact that the use of television has the capability of improving the relationship between the general public and minorities in a society.   

The predudice can be reduced by using those techniques. Minorities interact need to with the society, popular media is the great way to provide such a social contact. The expectation is the use of these techniques will lead to a positive change in perception within the general public. Use of the two discussed techniques should reduce the level of prejudice that is experienced by same sexual individuals in the society. Research indicates that television has a high chance of influencing the beliefs of people concerning various issues. This was evident in the case of “Will & Grace”. Since the initial airing of the program, the approval ratings of same sex marriages in the country has improved considerably. Television educates the public on issues that are not available elsewhere or will be controversial.
	
Mainstream media offer the interaction for the reduction of the current prejudice of gays in the country.
            
It is possible that the para social interactions described as a possible solution will offer a substitute interaction for the interpersonal interactions. Interpersonal interactions are vital in dealing with the problem of segregation. When the minorities interact with the society, the result of this is that members of the community understand the plight of such minorities. When this happens, the prejudice and mistreatment that exists between the two parties reduces and in some cases it is eradicated. Such contact may not be possible in a typical setting, which means that there is the need to seek other channels of providing such interactions. Para social interaction does provide this contact through the popular media.
	
Given the fact that the “Will & Grace” was successful in attracting an audience from the two divides, the use of the right platform can help in bridging the gap. In accordance, more popular shows, such as “Modern Family”, continue to offer the required interaction for the reduction of the current prejudice of gays in the country. Continued efforts may further improve the current approval rating to more than 70 percent using the mainstream media. 

“Will & Grace” show focuses on two friends of difference sexualism which have been rewarded by an improvement in the approval ratings of same-sex marriages. “Will & Grace” has been a successful despite the fact that its mains character was gay. The movie seeks to solve the LGBT problem, which is a social challenge in many societies around the world. Essentially, the show focuses on two friends of different sexualism. The efforts of the show have been rewarded by an improvement in the approval ratings of same-sex marriages. Ensuring that homosexuals are treated in the society as equals and use of the para social interactions is the best ways of approaching the challenge. The two can be provided using the mainstream shows. Essentially, movies and television shows that provide positive views on the gay community will improve the acceptability of this community. In accordance, the expectation is that the prejudice against LGBT will reduce if the two proposed solutions are implemented.
