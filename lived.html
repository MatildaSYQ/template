		<p>Since I can remember, my father used an old Kodak camera taking picture for me. He was really enjoy the process to record the valuable moment by using his old camera. And for me, it can be the most happy time spending with my father since this old camera gives us a lot of fun when we take picture with each other. My interesting of photography is came from my father’s old camera. I think it is amazing to retrospect the picture taking from the old camera. It represent my childhood and growing. Every single shot promopts me to recall the beautiful memory of my life. From then on, I was addicted to taking picture using camera. I have my own camera sine I was 12 which is the best day for me through life. I still remember the scene that I took photo everywhere and can not control my excited mood. I use it to record my life and show it on the internet like Instagraph and Photography enthusiasts website. I have met a lot of shutterbugs through the internet and have really good communication with them about photography. I enjoy this process just like my dad.

</p><p>The reason I choose to study in photography in University is not only because camera can help me record the important moment in life, but also something more important. Some day a friend of me came to ask me: photography, drawing and writing, which on do you think is the best. After thought for a moment, I response: I prefer the photography. However, the wirting and drawing can not be neglected. Everyone has there own perspective of it. But I think this kind of aesthetic can not be more described. I have keep a watch ful eye on some of shutterbugs on Posts Tagged. They often write some suitable and beautiful sentence under the picture they take which makes the picture more vivid and accessible. Some of the pictures with drawing and wrting even make me “froze” there for a long time. It can resonate my deep feeling. This is also the reason why I like photography. Because it is able to mix different art form together to produce something greatness. In reality, most people who can shoot but can not writing, or is able to writing but can not draw, and can draw but can not shoot. However, in my perspective, everyone has the same thinking model about their own creation, it is just has different forms. If he or she is a almighty person who can produce the three of art forms perfectly, the most great art work would be produced. I used to be facinated with some different kinds of ruined places. I was shocked by the decadent sense of beauty of it through time. What impresses people most is not the construction itself, but the left of everyday use. They stare you at sealed space and time which proved themselves’ existence and the story they have been through. In fact, it is the same thing to photography. As for the picture itself, it can be only the impact of visual effect. It will be normal when you look at it too much. However, the story hided and subsided behind the picture gives you great touch of reveria. These are the things attrated me most about photography. Then the theme, composition, light, thinking, sensory, and concept has enough power, even if it is from a small card machine.

</p><p>In addition, professional skill is undeniable needed in photography major. It includes Art foundation, art appreciation, lighting technology, photography The camera , The camera And skills, photographic composition, special photography, nonlinear editing, photography, advertising photography and so on. And these are all about how to make beautiful pictures. So it can not live without camera. There are lots of complicated elements in camera, which leads to different effect of picture. Focus, exposure, composition of a picture are three essential factors of photograph. The so-called exposure is refers to the film or the strength of the CCD sensor light induction; If you can't adjust to the most suitable for the light intensity, negative CCD cannot correct record and confirm the image. And the strength of the light, can through adjusting aperture and shutter speed to control. My favorate time is taking picture with my friend. It is so amazing when the picture came out with the proper light and perfect use of every elements. 

</p><p>As the time goes by, the technique grows faster, the quality of people’s life improved a lot, the disire to purchase the inspirit enjoyment has also inceased. More and more people including me is eager to learn more about photography. And the job situation of photography after graduate is also promising such as Studio, newspaper, television, the cast, the film and television company, advertisement company and magazines company. The one I have been interested most is working at magazines’ company. I think the pictures come from magazines is so amazing and can be though-provoking. As everyone know, magazine is a kind of medium showing people worldwide life and specific field such as fashion, diet and science. Thus, I have more opportunities to travel around the world knowing more interesting story and culture and taking picture of the local people and building which can broad my eye horizon. The magazine I like most is named Chinese Cooking. The main reason I like it is Chinese Cooking almost embrace all kinds of chinese cate. And the photographer who work for chinese cooking can travel all around china to acknowledge the local people’s life and the diet habit, then taking amazing picture for them. I really enjoy the process to get tpuch with new people and culture and take memorable picture for them through my own aesthetic and unique angle of view. So I will definitely work hard to study photography well in the future. 

</p><p>I like something glorious, so I hope the glory can freeze-frame at a moment and take shot for something can shocked myself. Everyone has their own purposes to study photography. I think interests is the most important of people studing in photography. A camera can not only record people’s life, but it can also improve people’s life better which enhance the people’s life quality and add people’s aesthetic about life by make life scene more vivid and memorable. No one could deny that the existence of camera makes our life more beautiful and vivid. People use it to cultivate their hobbies. And it also can promote people’s relationship to each other by sharing pictures taken by themselves through bolg and wechat. The advantage of leanring photography is able to work in, much the same way to relax body and mind, and be able to record each be worth to collect memories of moments in your life. To be able to find a reason for you to travel more. With the camera, search each beautiful scenery! It can also exercise the body, can the body more from the office, TV, computer, feel the beauty of nature, can make many friends, for his own amateur life. Still perhaps can be a tie in front of you to talk about, don't talk about other sensitive issues, unconsciously and friendship pulled close distance.
