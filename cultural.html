			<h1>Cultural Analysis Proposal</h1>
			<p>

<p>The United States has been divided on the issue of gay rights and marriage. There is a section of the society that supports them while the other one does not. The same has been the case among the political leaders. In 1998, the situation was worse, and a majority of American citizens were opposed to gays. Still, NBC premiered a show named “Will & Grace”, which succeeded amidst fears of failure given the record set by the shows before it that focused on the same topic. The show aired until 2006, and by then the acceptability of lesbians and gays was low, but it has improved. In accordance, the show had made a vital contribution on the reduction of prejudice. Despite this, there is the need of having a solution that would provide a sustained improvement in the acceptability of gays in the community. 

</p><p>The first time a lead character was gay on a primetime show, the end results were devastating. “Ellen” first aired on ABC in 1997 and featured Ellen Morgan. She was a lesbian struggling with her personal life as a gay American. Initially the reception was good, but that drastically reduced and eventually it was a total failure. The reaon of the failure is that American public is lack of tolerance of gay and community. Many critics viewed this outcome to have been attributed to the American public lack of tolerance on gay communities. Interestingly, in 1998 “Will & Grace” premiered on NBC despite the negative reception of Ellen.
</p><p>The show follows Will Truman, a lawyer based in New York City who is from a relationship with a man. Truman has a friend, Grace Adler, who is an interior designer. She is straight, and at the beginning of the show, she left her fiancé on the wedding day. In college, the two began dating before Will revealed to Grace that he was gay. Given the fact that Grace is straight, they decided to be friends for the rest of their lives. The relationship between the two was based on a relationship between one of the creators, Mutchnick, and Janet his friend. 

</p><p>Will’s friend, Jack McFarland, also features prominently in the cast. He is also gay and play the role of a comic relief together with Karen Walker who is Grace’s assistant. Critics and gay right institutions hailed the show because it had a positive representation of gays. In some extent, the show was competing for advertisement money with a show based on a heterosexual relationship “Dharma and Greg”, which was not a mean achievement for the creators of the show.

</p><p>The issue of homosexuality has been of public debate for a long time. In the United States, the issue of homosexuality has been of public debate for a long time. In living rooms and in Congress, it has been an issue attracting arguments from both sides. Despite the fact that approval ratings of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, and Transgender (LGBT) has been increasing, almost half of the American population does not approve of the relation according to the year of 2012 statistics. In 1998 when “Will and Grace” was premiering, the lack of approval for gay marriages was high. At the time, homosexual prejudice was at its peak, and it was manifested in various dimensions within the society. Some of the sections that homosexuality prejudice was highest were among college students, adolescents, and the adult population. While some Americans viewed it as a taboo because of their religious beliefs, some used cultural practices as their argument against the practice. Evidently, the public is changing its perception of LGBT, and the television has been a significant contributor.
	
</p><p>On the political scene, events surrounding the issue of homosexuality have been more dramatic than in the general public. The Republicans, in the year of 2004, were opposed to the subject of same sex marriage while the Democrats supported it, but could not publicly endorse it until last year. In effect, the Republicans made a move of banning same-sex marriage on ballots in Oregon, Michigan, and Ohio, which were key swing states. 
	
</p><p>The show made an effort of changing the image of the gay community on popular television. Prior to “Will & Grace” many shows in television on homosexuality were either represented negatively or absent. Mainstream television shows such as “Hawaii Five-O”, “M.D.”, and “Marcus Welby” are examples of media that portrayed homosexuals as deviants. Clearly, the perception was adopted from the view of the audience of these shows.  
	
</p><p>“Will & Grace” sought to represent the challenges of gays in establishing relationships. Still, it approached the issue of LGBT in a positive manner, which was not the case in many television shows with gay characters. There had been many negative stereotypes concerning gay men in television shows around the country. In many instances, which led the failure of many shows such as “Ellen”, there is a challenge of the heterosexual equilibrium.
	
</p><p>In many shows, the assumption has been that portraying lesbians positively would be extended to the gays. “Will & Grace” moved from this norm towards the realization of the fact that gays are different, and they require a positive representation. Many of the viewers of the shows, according to studies, stated that they knew at least one gay person. This is an indicator that the show was reaching an audience and affecting their perception of the gay community.  
	
</p><p>This has been successful given the fact that today, the approval ratings have increased, and the Democratic Party publicly embraces gay marriages. With a large portion of the public, movie creators, and political leaders indicating their unwillingness to support gays, “Will & Grace” embarked on a course to change this perception. The show sought to eradicate the stereotyping of the gay community through representing them positively in the mainstream media. This has been successful given the fact that today, the approval ratings have increased, and the Democratic Party publicly embraces gay marriages. In addition, the President of the United States of America supports same-sex marriage. The last episode of “Will and Grace” aired in 2006, and because of its success another show, “Modern Family” is now airing. The latter portrays gays positively.   

</p><p>Empirical studies into the issue of ethnic and minority groups segregation indicates that promotion of intergroup contact can have a positive effective in the reduction of prejudice of these groups by the majority. Essentially, there is the need for the minority groups to feel a sense of belonging, shared goals, non-superficial contact, and an equal status. In accordance, the eradication of stereotyping gays can only be possible through improved intergroup contact.  
	
</p><p>Given the fact that the challenge involved in the issue of gay rights is lack of the right information, it is vital to provide adequate positive information about LGBT. When members of a society have sufficient information concerning a certain issue, they may change the perception that they have concerning such topics. 
	
</p><p>We can improve the relationship between the general public and minorities in a society by strengthen social interaction like mediated interaction. Studies indicate that the use of a para-social interaction model may have positive results in the reduction of prejudice among a minority group. Scholars in the communication sector indicate that para social is a mediated interaction, which is similar to interpersonal interactions. This is because the human brain will perceives media experiences in a similar manner that it does with direct experiences. This means that the effect experienced by individuals through direct contact is possible through para social interaction. This interaction is in most cases referred to as a standard consequence of TV watching. This is an indicator of the fact that the use of television has the capability of improving the relationship between the general public and minorities in a society.   

</p><p>The predudice can be reduced by using those techniques. Minorities interact need to with the society, popular media is the great way to provide such a social contact. The expectation is the use of these techniques will lead to a positive change in perception within the general public. Use of the two discussed techniques should reduce the level of prejudice that is experienced by same sexual individuals in the society. Research indicates that television has a high chance of influencing the beliefs of people concerning various issues. This was evident in the case of “Will & Grace”. Since the initial airing of the program, the approval ratings of same sex marriages in the country has improved considerably. Television educates the public on issues that are not available elsewhere or will be controversial.
	
</p><p>Mainstream media offer the interaction for the reduction of the current prejudice of gays in the country.
            
</p><p>It is possible that the para social interactions described as a possible solution will offer a substitute interaction for the interpersonal interactions. Interpersonal interactions are vital in dealing with the problem of segregation. When the minorities interact with the society, the result of this is that members of the community understand the plight of such minorities. When this happens, the prejudice and mistreatment that exists between the two parties reduces and in some cases it is eradicated. Such contact may not be possible in a typical setting, which means that there is the need to seek other channels of providing such interactions. Para social interaction does provide this contact through the popular media.
	
</p><p>Given the fact that the “Will & Grace” was successful in attracting an audience from the two divides, the use of the right platform can help in bridging the gap. In accordance, more popular shows, such as “Modern Family”, continue to offer the required interaction for the reduction of the current prejudice of gays in the country. Continued efforts may further improve the current approval rating to more than 70 percent using the mainstream media. 

</p><p>“Will & Grace” show focuses on two friends of difference sexualism which have been rewarded by an improvement in the approval ratings of same-sex marriages. “Will & Grace” has been a successful despite the fact that its mains character was gay. The movie seeks to solve the LGBT problem, which is a social challenge in many societies around the world. Essentially, the show focuses on two friends of different sexualism. The efforts of the show have been rewarded by an improvement in the approval ratings of same-sex marriages. Ensuring that homosexuals are treated in the society as equals and use of the para social interactions is the best ways of approaching the challenge. The two can be provided using the mainstream shows. Essentially, movies and television shows that provide positive views on the gay community will improve the acceptability of this community. In accordance, the expectation is that the prejudice against LGBT will reduce if the two proposed solutions are implemented.
